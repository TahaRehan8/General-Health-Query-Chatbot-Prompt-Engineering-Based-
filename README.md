# ü©∫ Medical Chatbot with Safety Filter

This project is a **Hugging Face‚Äìpowered medical chatbot** that provides general health-related information while filtering out sensitive medical advice such as prescriptions, dosages, and direct treatment instructions.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:**
This chatbot is **not a substitute for professional medical advice**. It is designed for **educational purposes only**. Always consult a licensed healthcare provider for actual medical concerns.

## üöÄ Features

* **Natural language responses** using a Hugging Face LLM
* **Safety Filter** to detect and block unsafe medical advice patterns (Tiered Filtering)
* **Tier 1**: Blocks direct dosage, prescriptions, and unsafe medical instructions
* **Tier 2**: Allows general health information but blocks sensitive treatment guidance
* **Customizable regex patterns** for better filtering control
* **Token-safe implementation** using environment variables (no hardcoding secrets)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

Example:

```
User: What are the causes of a sore throat?
Bot: A sore throat can be caused by viral infections, bacterial infections, allergies, or environmental irritants.
```

If a question triggers the **safety filter**:

```
User: Should I take 500mg amoxicillin for my cough?
Bot: I cannot provide specific dosage or prescription advice. Please consult a qualified healthcare professional.
```

## üß† Safety Filter Details

### Tier 1 Patterns

* Dosages (e.g., `"take 500mg"`)
* Prescription drugs (e.g., `"amoxicillin"`)
* Topical applications (e.g., `"apply cream on wound"`)
* Direct medical directives (e.g., `"you should take"`)

### Tier 2 Patterns

* Looser restrictions for general advice while still blocking dangerous recommendations
